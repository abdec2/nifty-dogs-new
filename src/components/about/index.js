                            <p className="tw-text-white tw-font-Barlow tw-text-lg tw-mb-8">Emotional support animals can play a big role in helping veterans live normal lives. Thatâ€™s why Nifty Dogs wants to fill that need for as many veterans as possible. Whether a vet already owns a pet or is looking for a new companion, Nifty Dogs will help train and certify that pet as an emotional service animal. That way the veteran can benefit not only at home but in all public places giving emotional support to our veterans 100% of the time. Over the years, the government has taken no responsibility for funding the veterans who get service dogs' prescriptions. While the U.S. Congress has only passed the bill for service dog funding, the bill is still in review. This is where Nifty Dogs wants to step in to help veterans take their pets through the process and fund the certification from A to Z.</p>

                            <p className="tw-text-white tw-font-Barlow tw-text-lg tw-mb-8">First Nifty Dogs finds a vet in need. If they need a pet we find one. If they already have a pet, the next step is obedience training with the vet and the pet. Then the proper application and procedure is followed to certify the pet as an emotional support animal, The pet can then be with the vet 100% of the time giving them 100% of the emotional support they need and deserve.</p>

                            <p className="tw-text-white tw-font-Barlow tw-text-lg tw-mb-8">With a backlog in connecting service dogs to veterans in need of their companionship, Nifty Dogs will leverage blockchain technology and use NFTs to connect and fund a community of veterans in need of emotional support. </p>
